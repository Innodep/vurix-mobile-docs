## System Requirements

To run VURIX Mobile smoothly, the following system requirements are recommended:

**Supported Devices**

- iOS devices running **iOS/iPad 14.0 or Later**
- H.264, H265 codec support
- VURIX Server **1.7.0.220124 or later**
- Web API **1.7.0.220214 or later**

## Installation

### **Installing the Mobile App**

1. Open **Google Play Store** or **App Store**.
2. Search for **“VURIX”**.
3. Tap the **Install** button.
4. Once installed, tap **Open** to launch the app.


>**Important Notes:**

- VURIX Mobile connects via Web API, so the mobile network environment must allow the Web API server's IP to be accessible externally.
- If the Web API server is configured for external access, ensure that the RTSP service IP and port forwarding settings are correctly applied in the Web API server settings.
