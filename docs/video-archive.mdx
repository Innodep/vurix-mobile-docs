## Features

2. After selecting a **device from the Device List**, users must choose the **date and time** for playback.
   - The **calendar** only allows selecting dates with **available recorded data**.

3. Users can also access **Video Archives** through **Instant Video Search** from **Live Video**.

4. Select a **cell** or the **kebab menu** to view detailed device information.
   - In **Search Mode**, users can control **playback, use digital zoom, and save snapshots** from recorded videos.
   - You can **replace the video feed** with another or **remove an assigned video**.

## **Important Notes**
